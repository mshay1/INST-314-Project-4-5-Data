# INST-314-Project-4-5-Data
This repo has information collected from a Google Forms survey meant to investigate mental health and how it affects families. This Github repo contains one .csv file with survey answers to 13 questions from 10 respondents of the survey. The survey questions ranged from demographic questions, to respondents' opinions on what has caused increased reporting of mental illness today, to their favorite and least favorite things about life today, and then finally to what affects mothers', fathers', and childrens' mental health. Most questions are in long or short answer format, but age and years of schooling are in number format. This data was collected anonymously and no identifiying information was collected. This survey was done for Project 4&amp;5: Data collection and sharing (statistics in psychology) assignment in INST314.
